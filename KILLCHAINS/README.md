# KILLCHAINS

The term kill chain is a military concept which identifies the structure of an attack. It consists of:

- identification of target
- dispatching of forces to target
- initiation of attack on target
- destruction of target

Conversely, the idea of "breaking" an opponent's kill chain is a method of defense or preemptive action
