# About the author

I started my journey in 2014 -after 4 years of being a professionnal musician- as a System administrator and developer (Java, C# and Swift) before discovering Machine Learning in 2018. I then started to learn the fundamentals (Math, Calculus, Regression, Algorithms) with the Andrew Ng's course on Coursera, provided by the Standford University. I also started to learn Python, as it was then a raising language in a lot of fields, alongside japanese because... Hey why not ? Having to learn a non-latin alphabet language was interesting enough and between Cyrillic, korean and chinese, the japanese stood out with the most accessible and interesting online materials.

Even though the Machine Learning term was first cited and created in the late '50s, this field, now so-called AI, is relatively new and fast-evolving, so I wasn't feeling right about learning things that would become obsolete only a few months after having learned them.

As I still was looking for new challenges in 2022 (after two years of learning beekeeping), I had the feeling that CyberSecurity was the most demanding field in I.T. -as you have to know a lot about everything to really be efficient- and armed with my diverse expertise, this could be the career I was looking for to keep learning things and evolve.

I chose to quit my job in mid-2022 for an accelerated 'CyberSecurity Consultant-oriented SecOps' degree at Technobel, BE, until February 2024. At the same time, I started to participate in CTF - and even create a few - and learned a lot using TryHackMe, Root-Me, and online documentation.

As my courses was coming to the end, I learnt about all the possible career in cybersecurity ([And there are a lot](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/cyber-career-pathways-tool)), and I choose to make my graduate thesis about **Pentesting** and **Security Audit**, as it was the cybersecurity field that felt the more interesting to me in order to keep evolving.
